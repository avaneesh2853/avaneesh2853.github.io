**Creating a complete simulation environment using QEMU RISC V**
This project involves adding a custom peripheral and interacting with QEMU RISC V using bare-metal C code. RISC V is an open-source ISA that has been taking the computer architecture domain by storm. One can play around with the RISC V processor by emulating it in QEMU. QEMU is a open-source virtualizer and emulator. The idea is to use **libfemto**, a lightweight C library in  <u><a> href="{{https://github.com/axel-h/riscv-probe}}"riscv-probe</a></u>, which allows you to interact with the processor via **virt**, a VirtIO Virtual Machine environment.
