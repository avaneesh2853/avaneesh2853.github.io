About me
=======
Hello everyone, I am Avaneesh Sai, a third year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am currently pursuing my BTech degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

My research interests is in the domain of Computer Architecture, and I am particularly excited by the fields of heterogeneous computing, GP-GPUs and near-memory computing. I am also deeply excited by the intersections of Machine Learning and Computer Architecture. 

Other than that, I enjoy playing sports, especially football(hence the dedicated page) and am an avid moviebuff.
